### News:  

2021-06-25
- We finished our Season 2. This portal goes now into the dormant state. Please visit [ GCCollab: R4GC Community](https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/7391537/r4gc) for all information related to our future "Lunch and Learn Data Science with R" meet-ups and related knowledgebase.
- Additionally, for GC employees and partners, the wiki page is now created, with links to all available discussion topics and resources: <https://wiki.gccollab.ca/UseR!>

2021-04-30: 
- Friday Lunch and Learn R Meet-ups moved from 11:30 to 12:05. See [ GCCollab Group](https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/7855030/friday-lunch-and-learn-r-meet-ups) for all details. 
- The Apps that we have developped are now also hosted at: <https://open-canada.github.io/Apps>.

2021-04-23: 
- We now have a new Use R! portal hosted here at `open-canada` GitHub account! This portal is the continuation of the efforts started last year at [R Ottawa](https://IVI-M.github.io/R-Ottawa/), now supported by a larger community of government employees from  around the country. Hope you will find it useful!
- New pages created:
  - [ Season 2 (Spring 2021) of Lunch and Learn R meet-ups: Building packages - from scratch](learn2021.md). 
  - [ Season 1 (Summer 2020) of Lunch and Learn R meet-ups: Building COVID-19 Web App - from scratch](learn2020.md). 


2021-04-16: 
- We have started a new series of hands-on "build from scratch" tutorials - focused on developing skills for building your own R packages.  The objective is to build a variety of useful packages for common use by all, using the codes contributed by the community.
   -  GC employees and partners, please visit  [ GCCollab Group](https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/7855030/friday-lunch-and-learn-r-meet-ups) for more details, notes and recordings from these meetups. 


2021-03-26: 
- The deck and video-recording from the 
seminar  *"Data Engineering with R, R Markdown, Shiny and algorithms"* (by Dmitry Gorodnichy)
organized by Statistics Canada for the Applied machine learning for text analysis community of practice are now posted at  <https://gccollab.ca/event_calendar/view/7556628> 

2021-02-27: 
- GC employees, head to [https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc) for more resources and codes related to R coding and usage at GC! Join us for informal 'Lunch and Learn's meet-ups every Friday at 11:30. - See [GCcollab](https://gccollab.ca/groups/activity/7071541) for more information.

2021-02-21:
- Data Engineering Demo is ready for the #GCData2021 Conference Data Literacy workshop: [https://rCanada.shinyapps.io/demo/](https://rCanada.shinyapps.io/demo/). See workshop [GCcollab](https://gccollab.ca/groups/activity/7071541) page for the associated deck and video-recording of the workshop

2021-01-06:
- Join us at the *Data Engineering workshop* on 22 February, organized within the Fifth Annual Data Conference ([#GCData2021 / #Donn√©esGC2021](https://wiki.gccollab.ca/2021_Data_Conference/Agenda)). Hosted by CBSA, *"the workshop will overview the challenges and solutions related to data engineering. You will be able to experience some of data engineering  challenges first-hand, and see how these challenges can be solved using  modern  data science tools such as R and RStudio. The work on developing an R package and Shiny application to assist with data cleaning and linking will be presented."* 


2020-12-10:
- Following the announcement at the Data Science Network for the Federal Public Service (DSNFPS) [newsletter](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/data-science/network/newsletter), we received multiple requests for another R training, like the one we did last Summer. Why not?
<!-- - Let's do it then!  Tentative starting date -  First Friday of March 2021 (after #GCData2021  Conference).
We will show you how to use Data Science (in R) to gain
insights from the [Public Service Employee Survey (PSES)](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey.html) results - similar to how this is done [here](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/PSES/). -->
To enroll and more details - see [ R101](learn2021.md).    

2020-06-05:
- We finished the first season, where we learnt how to write an interactive dashboard that visualizes the COVID datain US. - You can see the final result [here](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid/us.Rmd)!   All codes and resourcea are posted [here](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101). Have great summer!

<!-- 
2020-05-13:
-  35 mins a week seemed not enough... Following requests, we'll add another R101 "Lunch and Learn" session on Fridays, the same time.
-->

2020-05-03:
- YouTube channel created: [R101 "Learning R together" (Building Data Science Apps from scratch)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUogPW3t8g0RFvDGyKo1murnQUaSJxEPl). If you missed a session, you can now watch it there. Session transcripts are also posted in  [ R101](101.md).
- Ideas for homework are added in [ Resources](resources.md)

2020-04-28:
- We've heard you: You want to get all the power and fun of R, but you don't know where to start --  Starting this week, we'll show you how you can start learning and using R in absolutely no time and even without any software installed on your computer! All you'll need is to login to [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and we'll guide you through after that. We will be developing a COVID App from scratch - together! Sessions will be recorded. 

<!-- 2020-04-15: 
- Codes to read Covid data from UofT and JHU are added to [ /r101](https://github.com/IVI-M/R-Ottawa/tree/master/r101) folder.
-->

2020-04-01:     
- Invitation to [Lunches with Data Challenges](meetups.md) meet-ups is extended from CBSA to all GoC. See: [GCCollab](https://gccollab.ca/discussion/view/4482867/enlunches-with-data-challenges-on-wednesdays-on-rfr)* 
- The focus of discussion becomes Covid-19 and what we (R enthusiasts and learners) can do about it.

2020-03-18
- Our informal Wednesday's "Morning Coffees with Data Challenges" meetings, which we've been having in CBSA since  Summer 2019, go online,  becoming "Lunches".
