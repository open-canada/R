# Lunch and Learn R Meet-ups

[ Home](index.md) --  [ Resources](resources.md)  --  [ Season 1](learn2020.md) 


This page provides information related the Second season of "Lunch and Learn R" seminars organized by Dmitry Gorodnichy with his colleagues in Gov't of Canada. 
In interactive hands-on way, they show how to learn and master R - one of the most popular tools used for data analysis and visualization -
using open source resources. 
The sessions are 45 mins long and run every Friday at lunch time via MS Teams, with the objective to develop something useful for community by the end of 8-10 sessions,
e.g., a Web App or package that can  visualize some complex and  valuable data, the plenty of which is available at 
[open.canada.ca](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data).
<!-- build from scratch AI and Data Science tools  R. 
<!-- Data Science Apps, such as [iTrack Covid](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid), using  R. 
These 40-min sessions are done via MS Teams each Friday, are open to public and are recorded. 
If you missed a session, you can catch up by watch it on 
-->
No programming experience or data science background required. No installation of software is needed either. 
If you don't have RStudio installed on your machine, you can code in [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). It's  free, no subscription required, and is greatly supported by community.

For whom: Open to all GC employees and collaborators    
When: Every Friday at Lunch time (12:00 - 12:50)   
How: Via MS Teams.  **Dial-in instructions** are posted at the  [**GCCollab page**](https://gccollab.ca/groups/about/7855030):

# Season 2 (Spring 2021)


 This new 2021 series of hands-on ("build from scratch") tutorials is focused on developing skills for building your own R packages. 
 The objective is to build a variety of useful packages for common use by all, using the codes contributed by the community. 
 This includes as the ones to read, analyze and visualize COVID-19 stats, ATIP requestes, PSES and Election results, among others.

Main Topic: "Converting your useful and complex codes into packges for common use by everyone"

Sub-topics:  
- How to best leverage GCcode (GitLab for GC)
- Make `data.table` your closest friend!
- Why think OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- R vs. Python, R and Python
- Text analysis and Topic extraction using ATIP data
- Uncovering hidden insights from PSES, ATIP and Canada Election results using Data Science       
- Foundations for robust, scalable, collaborative data programming


Summary:   

This season of the "Lunch and Learn R" meetups is dedicated to developing skills for building your own  R packages. We'll use the R codes already contributed by the GC community and will learn  - as always together, with host - how to convert these codes to packages that can be (re)used by your other GC colleagues and the rest of the world.
<!-- Some of these codes have been already incorporated into tools used by other (eg. 
to con the results of the [Public Service Employee Survey (PSES)](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey.html).
 similar to how this is done [here](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/PSES/). -->
In doing that, 
we'll  be learning not only about packages, but also about data coding in general, what it means to code collabortively, using the best tools and methodologies developed
by increasingly growing international community.
We will also talk about data engineeing problems and the problems of "bias" in automated systems -- and see what can be done to deal with those problems.


About the host:    

<!-- In contrast to majority of his colleagues in Government of Canada, who came to Date Science from Mathematics, Statistics, Natural or Social Sciences, -->
Dmitry Gorodnichy came to Data Science from *Computer Science* , or *Computing Science* - the way it is called at University of Alberta, where he  did his [Ph.D.](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/theses/Pages/item.aspx?idNumber=52241254) and was the course coordinator and instructor for *Introduction to Computing Science* [(CMPUT-101)](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/introduction-to-computing.html).
The term "Data Science" was introduced recently, whereas the term *Computing Science*  --- or "Informatics", the way it is called in French, and [Cybernetics](http://incyb.kiev.ua/?lang=en), the way it is also called in Europe --- existed for over half a century.
This defines a critical difference in the way Dmitry approaches and teaches "Data Science". -  It is Computer Science driven. What does it mean? Join the meeting to find out! Dmitry is also a musician, so he will also entertain you with some live music!
